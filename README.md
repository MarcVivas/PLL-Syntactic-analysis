## Introduction
The aim of this project is to utilize an automatic syntactic analyzer generation tool for language identification purposes. The instructions to complete the project are available in Catalan and can be found in the `Statement.pdf` document.

## Required libraries/packages
You will need to install the next libraries (Ubuntu) if you want to run the programs:

Flex:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y flex
```
Make:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y make
```

Bison:
```bash
sudo apt install bison
```
## Exercise 1
There are `9` tests available that have been used to check the correctness of the exercise. Each test file contains a comment indicating whether the file is in the correct format or not. If the test file is not in the correct format, there is also a comment indicating in which lines the program should throw an error.

For a CNF DIMACS file to be considered correct, it must contain a header `p cnf (num > 0) (num > 0)` followed by at least one newline `\n`. The header must be followed by clauses, each of which must end with a `0`. Each clause can be written with any number of newlines between each literal.

You will be able to better understand the characteristics of the implementation by looking at the test files.
