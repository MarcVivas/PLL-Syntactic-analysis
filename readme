## Exercise 1
### Considerations
1. For an LL GRAMMAR file to be considered correct, it must be empty or contain lines with productions, separating the left and right side of each production by ":", and with the productions separated by "|". The end of the line is marked by a semicolon (";"). spaces, tabs, newlines etc are not taken into account, and you can add comments with  "//"
2. You will be able to better understand the characteristics of the implementation by looking at the test files.

### Tests
1. There are `9` tests available that have been used to check the correctness of the exercise.
2. Each test file contains a comment indicating whether the file is in the correct format or not.
3. If the test file is not in the correct format, there is also a comment indicating in which lines the program should throw an error.
4. If the test passes for an incorrect file, it means it detected the correct error.
5. To facilitate testing, a Python script named `test.py` was created. Running the script with the next command will automatically execute all the test cases and check their results.
```bash
python3 test.py
```
> Note: It is not necessary to compile the Flex and Bison programs to run the script.
